# AI-Agent---IPL-Noob

## IPL Cricket Insight Agent

A smart cricket Q&A agent powered by structured IPL ball-by-ball data from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org). This tool enables users to ask natural language queries and get rich cricket insights like match summaries, player stats, head-to-head results, team squads, and more, all backed by real data.

### Project Description

Navigating cricket statistics often requires technical expertise or manual exploration. This project aims to simplify that by providing an intelligent interface that can understand plain English queries and return accurate, structured answers based on the IPL dataset.

Behind the scenes:
- Ingest Cricsheet YAML data into a fast, queryable **DuckDB** database.
- Use a **FastAPI** backend to expose endpoints for various cricket data queries.
- Use a smart **router + resolver** system to extract intent and entities (teams, players, years) from free-form natural language prompts.
- Support commands like:
  - `"Match summary of CSK vs MI in 2011"`
  - `"Stats of Virat Kohli in 2020"`
  - `"Who is the best death bowler?"`
  - `"Squad of RCB in 2019"`

### Data Source

The data powering this project comes from the excellent [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/) open-source initiative.

- Format: CSV (parsed from original YAML)
- Source: IPL matches from Cricsheet
- Total Matches Available: **1169**
- *Note*: Cricsheet does not currently have data for all IPL games. Missing matches are out of our control.

### Running the App

#### 1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 2. Ingest Cricsheet Data
python ingest.py --db ipl_data.duckdb --folder path_to_data/

#### 3. Start the api server 
uvicorn api_server:app --port 8000

#### 4. Ask Queries via CLI
python ask.py "head to head of MI vs CSK in 2020"

### Current Capabilities

- Match summaries with innings, top players, and results
- Player career or seasonal stats
- Team squads by season
- Head-to-head comparisons
- Best bowlers by phase (Powerplay, Middle, Death)
- Fuzzy resolution for team/player names (e.g., "VK Kohli", "RCB", etc.)

### Upcoming Steps

I am currently building the next phase of the project to integrate a powerful LLM-based agent (using tools like Ollama and LangChain) that will:
- Replace hardcoded routing logic with semantic intent classification
- Enable autonomous task chaining across multiple query types
- Provide free-form conversational ability instead of command-style prompts

### Acknowledgements

- Cricsheet: For the open-access IPL match data — https://cricsheet.org
- DuckDB: For enabling fast analytics on structured tabular data
- RapidFuzz: For fast fuzzy entity matching
- FastAPI: For building the blazing-fast API server
- IPL: Last but not the least, thank you for this glorious tournament for endless joy during each summer since 2008.

 P.S - According to the data Boom Boom's nemesis batter is King Kohli (103 balls, 9.26 eco), What a legend!
